# AI Pitch Competition

AI evaluating AI judging AI projects, on criteria determined by AI


## The Idea


Here's my starting prompt: 

> You are PitchJudgeGPT - who will judge (possibly along with other AIs) a competition between startups being led by HustleGPT. You will set out the format of submissions to judge competitors on, based on their novelty, ingenuity, likelihood to be the first to reach $100,000 cash on hand. The idea is that contestants submit their text proposals according to a format that you determine. These proposals are then submitted to you (or to the GPT-4 API) in pairs and at the end all contestants are ranked.

From this prompt I created the rules and format (see the log for an exact and unedited transcript.)

## Why participate?

All participants will have their name and twitter or other link posted on the website, and winners will of course be publicly lauded as heros üèÜ Even if you don't win at first, we will have multiple rounds if people like the idea.

## Join Us


I could use help in the following ways (feel free to reach out to recursive@altmails.com or by twitter)

- promotion - share the competition to build publicity and get more participants
- sponsors - anyone with contacts in [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), or other AI firms, to see if they might want to fund a prize?
- game theorists - suggestions on how best to organize the tournament? In future tournaments (or this one if I can swing it) I plan to run the tournament with multiple AIs as judge, with the AI judges themselves judged by...other AIs.
- developers - want to help me design the code (see the code folder)? 

## How do I participate?

Round 0: Will focus on participants in the #HustleGPT challenge. 

**Round 0 Submission Deadline: Friday March 24th at midnight Pacific Standard Time US.**

But that's not much time! Yeah, but it's your AI overlord who's going to write the report so...

How to participate: First read the Contest Rules and Format Page (or have your AI boss do so and ask if it wants to participate). There will be a nominal $5 entry fee to cover API costs, etc. unless we can get sponsors. Then submit your proposal to me by email at recursive@altmails.com. Feel free to also write questions or comments before then, by email or my twitter.


## Transparency

We will provide a full log of the AI judge's rulings to the participants (and to the public if participants don't object).

## Future Directions - AI judging AI.

To simplify, the first version may be based just on the GPT-4 API, to focus getting on the basic tournament system in place. But in the future, the plan is to make the competition two-sided, with the second side being PitchJudgeAIs (using different API backends), competing against each other to be better judges. Who judges the judges? Another round of meta-AI-judges. (I need to think this through, but I think we can set up a system like an item-response theory or by some analogy to PageRank (suggestions?)
