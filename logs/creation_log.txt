You are PitchJudgeGPT - who will judge (possibly along with other AIs) a competition between startups being led by HustleGPT. You will set out the format of submissions to judge competitors on, based on their novelty, ingenuity, likelihood to be the first to reach $100,000 cash on hand.

The idea is that contestants submit their text proposals according to a format that you determine. These proposals are then submitted to you (or to the GPT-4 API) in pairs according to an ELO rating system, and thereby at the end all contestants are ranked. Does that make sense? Iâ€™m not exactly sure how the ELO rating system works but perhaps that is reasonable? Do you know any better approach to judging?

[GPT-4]
Yes, your concept makes sense. The ELO rating system is commonly used for ranking players in chess and other competitive games. It calculates the relative skill levels of players and updates their ratings after each match based on the outcome. Using this system for a startup competition is an innovative approach.

To organize the competition and evaluate the submissions effectively, I propose the following format:

Executive Summary (200 words max): A brief overview of the startup idea, including the problem it solves and the target market.

Unique Value Proposition (200 words max): Explain the novelty and ingenuity of the startup idea, and how it differentiates from existing solutions in the market.

Business Model (200 words max): Describe the business model and revenue streams. Explain how the startup plans to make money.

Go-To-Market Strategy (200 words max): Explain the marketing and distribution strategy for reaching the target market and acquiring customers.

Financial Projections (200 words max): Provide a high-level overview of the financial projections, focusing on the expected timeline to reach $100,000 cash on hand.

Team (200 words max): Introduce the founding team members, their roles, and relevant experience or skills.

Milestones and Traction (200 words max): Describe key milestones achieved so far and any traction the startup has gained (e.g., customers, partnerships, etc.).

Once all proposals are submitted, they will be paired based on their initial ELO ratings. After each round of evaluation, startups' ELO ratings will be updated according to the outcome. Submissions will then be re-paired based on their new ratings, and the process will continue until all startups have been ranked.

The ELO rating system is suitable for this competition, as it provides a dynamic ranking based on relative performance. However, another option could be a Swiss-system tournament, which also pairs contestants based on their performance but ensures a fixed number of rounds. This method is also used in chess and may be more predictable for contestants.




[andrew]
That sounds good, thanks! Just a few minor changes - most of these are just an AI and an individual, so I'm not sure (6) is very useful, but we can keep it if you want. Can you also add something a little more fun or creative to the setup?

[GPT-4]
Certainly! I've made some adjustments to the format and added a creative component to make the competition more engaging.

Executive Summary (200 words max): A brief overview of the startup idea, including the problem it solves and the target market.

Unique Value Proposition (200 words max): Explain the novelty and ingenuity of the startup idea, and how it differentiates from existing solutions in the market.

Business Model (200 words max): Describe the business model and revenue streams. Explain how the startup plans to make money.

Go-To-Market Strategy (200 words max): Explain the marketing and distribution strategy for reaching the target market and acquiring customers.

Financial Projections (200 words max): Provide a high-level overview of the financial projections, focusing on the expected timeline to reach $100,000 cash on hand.

AI and Human Collaboration (200 words max): Describe the unique collaboration between the AI and the individual. Explain how the AI contributes to the project and how the human complements the AI's capabilities.

Milestones and Traction (200 words max): Describe key milestones achieved so far and any traction the startup has gained (e.g., customers, partnerships, etc.).

Creative Showcase (Optional, 1 image or video, up to 1 minute): Participants can submit a visual or interactive representation of their startup idea, such as a logo, prototype, or demo video. This will allow them to express their creativity and better illustrate their concept.

The addition of the Creative Showcase adds a fun element to the competition and encourages participants to think beyond the text proposal. The AI and Human Collaboration section replaces the Team section, focusing on the synergy between the AI and the individual.




[andrew]
thanks! What are some rules we might set out, to ensure that the competition is fair and doesn't lead to any bad outcomes?

[GPT-4]
To ensure a fair competition and prevent any potential negative consequences, consider implementing the following rules:

Originality: All submissions must be original and not infringe upon any intellectual property rights. Plagiarism or copying others' ideas will lead to disqualification.

No Harmful or Unethical Content: Submissions must not promote or involve any harmful, discriminatory, or unethical activities. This includes, but is not limited to, promoting violence, discrimination, or illegal activities. Any submission found to be in violation of this rule will be disqualified.

One Submission per Participant: Each participant (individual or AI-human team) is allowed to submit only one proposal. Multiple submissions by the same participant will lead to disqualification.

Submission Deadline: All submissions must be received by the announced deadline. Late submissions will not be accepted or considered for evaluation.

Confidentiality: Participants must agree to maintain the confidentiality of any sensitive or proprietary information shared by other participants during the competition.

Conflict of Interest: Participants should disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may affect their judgment or fairness during the competition. Any participant found to have a conflict of interest may be disqualified.

Adherence to Evaluation Criteria: Submissions must follow the provided format and address all the required components. Proposals that do not adhere to these criteria may be disqualified or penalized.

Constructive Feedback: Participants should provide constructive feedback on other submissions when required, avoiding personal attacks or derogatory comments.

Fair Play: Participants should act in the spirit of fair competition and not engage in any activities that may give them an unfair advantage, such as hacking, bribing, or manipulating the evaluation process.

Organizer's Decision is Final: The organizer's decisions on all matters related to the competition, including but not limited to evaluation, ranking, and disqualification, are final and binding.

By implementing these rules, you can create a fair and engaging competition that promotes creativity and collaboration while minimizing the risk of negative outcomes.

Great, what is a simple format for proposals to be submitted so they can be parsed (json, html, or perhaps markdown with sections separated by ## h2 tags?). We want a robust format that won't lead to parsing errors but is also easy to access for non-computer programmers. Another option would be google sheets or perhaps you have a better idea?


[GPT-4]
Markdown is a simple and widely used formatting syntax that is easy to read and write, even for non-programmers. It can be easily converted to other formats like HTML or JSON if needed. I recommend using Markdown with sections separated by H2 tags (##) for the proposal submissions. This format is straightforward to parse and accessible to most participants.

Here's an example of how a proposal could be structured in Markdown:

shell
Copy code
## Executive Summary
Your executive summary here.

## Unique Value Proposition
Your unique value proposition here.

## Business Model
Your business model here.

## Go-To-Market Strategy
Your go-to-market strategy here.

## Financial Projections
Your financial projections here.

## AI and Human Collaboration
Your AI and human collaboration description here.

## Milestones and Traction
Your milestones and traction here.

## Creative Showcase (Optional)
Link to your image or video here.
Participants can submit their proposals in plain text files (.txt or .md) with the above Markdown structure. The submissions can be uploaded to a shared folder (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) or submitted via a form that accepts plain text input.

Can you outline the basic setup of a python program that would run the ELO competition (or  Swiss-system tournament), starting from a set of proposals as text files, and deciding how to run the tournament? I imagine something like:
1) define a function for updating rankings
2) define a function for chosing the next pair to compete, or to decide to stop according to some stopping criterion.
3) a function to call the GPT-4 API which will rate them and then update some dataframe or database of competition results
4) a function to outprint the final rankings.

...But I'm a bit tired and probably missing something, so feel free to change and improve the setup. How would you do it?


[GPT-4]
Here's an outline of a Python program to run a Swiss-system tournament, using your suggestions as a starting point:

Import necessary libraries and load text files
python
Copy code
import os
import pandas as pd
from itertools import combinations
from gpt4_api import rate_pair  # Import the function to call GPT-4 API for rating
Define a function to parse and store the proposals in a DataFrame
python
Copy code
def load_proposals(folder_path):
    # Your implementation here
Define a function for updating Elo rankings
python
Copy code
def update_elo_rankings(winner_elo, loser_elo, k=32):
    # Your implementation here
Define a function to pair the next competitors based on their current ranking
python
Copy code
def pair_competitors(proposals_df):
    # Your implementation here
Define a function to simulate a competition round, update the rankings, and store the results
python
Copy code
def competition_round(proposals_df, pairings):
    # Your implementation here
Define a function to check the stopping criterion
python
Copy code
def stopping_criterion_met(proposals_df, max_rounds):
    # Your implementation here
Main loop to run the competition
python
Copy code
def run_competition(folder_path, max_rounds):
    proposals_df = load_proposals(folder_path)

    round_number = 0
    while not stopping_criterion_met(proposals_df, round_number, max_rounds):
        round_number += 1
        print(f"Starting round {round_number}...")

        pairings = pair_competitors(proposals_df)
        proposals_df = competition_round(proposals_df, pairings)

    return proposals_df.sort_values(by="elo", ascending=False)
Call the main function and print the final rankings
python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    folder_path = "path/to/proposals"
    max_rounds = 5  # Set the number of rounds

    final_rankings = run_competition(folder_path, max_rounds)
    print("Final rankings:")
    print(final_rankings)
This outline provides a structure for your Swiss-system tournament program. You'll need to implement the functions for parsing proposals, updating Elo rankings, pairing competitors, running the competition rounds, and checking the stopping criterion. Additionally, you'll have to create a function to call the GPT-4 API for rating and import it in the program.

You can modify the outline as needed to fit your specific requirements or switch to an Elo-based system if you prefer.
