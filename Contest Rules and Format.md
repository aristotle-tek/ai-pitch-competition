## Submission Format

1. Executive Summary (200 words max): A brief overview of the startup idea, including the problem it solves and the target market.

2. Unique Value Proposition (200 words max): Explain the novelty and ingenuity of the startup idea, and how it differentiates from existing solutions in the market.

3. Business Model (200 words max): Describe the business model and revenue streams. Explain how the startup plans to make money.

4. Go-To-Market Strategy (200 words max): Explain the marketing and distribution strategy for reaching the target market and acquiring customers.

5. Financial Projections (200 words max): Provide a high-level overview of the financial projections, focusing on the expected timeline to reach $100,000 cash on hand.

6. AI and Human Collaboration (200 words max): Describe the unique collaboration between the AI and the individual. Explain how the AI contributes to the project and how the human complements the AI's capabilities.

7. Milestones and Traction (200 words max): Describe key milestones achieved so far and any traction the startup has gained (e.g., customers, partnerships, etc.).

8. Creative Showcase (Optional, 1 image or video, up to 1 minute): Participants can submit a visual or interactive representation of their startup idea, such as a logo, prototype, or demo video. This will allow them to express their creativity and better illustrate their concept.

The addition of the Creative Showcase adds a fun element to the competition and encourages participants to think beyond the text proposal. The AI and Human Collaboration section replaces the Team section, focusing on the synergy between the AI and the individual.


## Rules


1. Originality: All submissions must be original and not infringe upon any intellectual property rights. Plagiarism or copying others' ideas will lead to disqualification.

2. No Harmful or Unethical Content: Submissions must not promote or involve any harmful, discriminatory, or unethical activities. This includes, but is not limited to, promoting violence, discrimination, or illegal activities. Any submission found to be in violation of this rule will be disqualified.

3. One Submission per Participant: Each participant (individual or AI-human team) is allowed to submit only one proposal. Multiple submissions by the same participant will lead to disqualification.

4. Submission Deadline: All submissions must be received by the announced deadline. Late submissions will not be accepted or considered for evaluation.

5. Confidentiality: Participants must agree to maintain the confidentiality of any sensitive or proprietary information shared by other participants during the competition.

6. Conflict of Interest: Participants should disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may affect their judgment or fairness during the competition. Any participant found to have a conflict of interest may be disqualified.

7. Adherence to Evaluation Criteria: Submissions must follow the provided format and address all the required components. Proposals that do not adhere to these criteria may be disqualified or penalized.

8. Constructive Feedback: Participants should provide constructive feedback on other submissions when required, avoiding personal attacks or derogatory comments.

9. Fair Play: Participants should act in the spirit of fair competition and not engage in any activities that may give them an unfair advantage, such as hacking, bribing, or manipulating the evaluation process.

10. Organizer's Decision is Final: The organizer's decisions on all matters related to the competition, including but not limited to evaluation, ranking, and disqualification, are final and binding.

11. (added by Andrew) There will be nominal fee of $5 for participating, all of which will go towards covering API costs and a prize for winners.

12. (added by Andrew) Participants in the HustleGPT challenge must have their decisionmaking primarily led by GPT or another AI; fewer points will be awarded for humans taking an active role in primary decisionmaking rather than implementing AI decisions.

## File formatting

It will be easier if files are formatted uniformly for parsing (but hey if not, the AI will figure it out probably.) Here's an example of how a proposal could be structured in Markdown:


	## Executive Summary
	Your executive summary here.

	## Unique Value Proposition
	Your unique value proposition here.

	## Business Model
	Your business model here.

	## Go-To-Market Strategy
	Your go-to-market strategy here.

	## Financial Projections
	Your financial projections here.

	## AI and Human Collaboration
	Your AI and human collaboration description here.

	## Milestones and Traction
	Your milestones and traction here.

	## Creative Showcase (Optional)
	Link to your image or video here.

	## Privacy and other concerns
	Specify if you would like your proposal to be publicly shared or kept private (ugh, I thought the fun was building in public....) or other concerns.
	You could also tell us in any ways your proposal doesn't fit the rules (e.g. I started working on this before I had AI directing me...)

Participants can submit their proposals in plain text files (.txt or .md) with the above Markdown structure. The submissions can be emailed to recursive@altmails.com
