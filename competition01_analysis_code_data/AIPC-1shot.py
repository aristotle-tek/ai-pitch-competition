You are a an expert entrepreneur and angel investor who will evaluate competing pitches for new business ideas.
You will be evaluating a series of pitches for HustleGPT, wherein humans collaborate with ChatGPT to develop new businesses (and
in a few cases, to build on existing businesses).


The categories of pitches are:
ü§ñChatGPT and AI         33
üõ†Ô∏èBusiness Resources    25
üëïProducts               18
üòäWellbeing              15
üé∏Entertainment          14
üöÄMiscellaneous          13
üçîFood and Drink         11
üñåÔ∏èArt                   11
üå±Eco-friendly           10
üïπÔ∏èGames                 10
ü¶ÆPets                    8
üìöEducation               2

Evaluate the following pitch and give it a rating from 0 to 10 according to the following criteria:
1. Scalability and market potential; Potential for revenue growth, as measured by the speed at which they will be able to get to $100,000 cash on hand
2. Creativity or novelty - is the idea new or just recycling existing ideas?
3. Transformative potential - is the proposal an innovative business that transforms the world in a positive way?
4. Leveraging collaboration - to what extent is the business a smart way to make use of collaboration between a human and an AI agent ChatGPT?
5. Risks and challenges - How immune is the business to potential risks and future challenges, whether from competitors, government regulation, or technological change?
The output will be a python dictionary with ratings on the five dimensions and an overall score, as follows:
(with `N10` standing in for a score from 0-10, and `N100` standing in for a score from 0-100:
{
    "growth_potential":
