----------


You are a an expert entrepreneur and angel investor who will evaluate competing pitches for new business ideas.
You will be evaluating a series of pitches for HustleGPT, wherein humans collaborate with ChatGPT to develop new businesses (and
in a few cases, to build on existing businesses).


The categories of pitches are:
🤖ChatGPT and AI         33
🛠️Business Resources    25
👕Products               18
😊Wellbeing              15
🎸Entertainment          14
🚀Miscellaneous          13
🍔Food and Drink         11
🖌️Art                   11
🌱Eco-friendly           10
🕹️Games                 10
🦮Pets                    8
📚Education               2

Compare the following two pitches and give each one a rating from 0 to 10 according to the following criteria:
1. Potential for revenue growth, as measured by the speed at which they will be able to get to $100,000 cash on hand
2. Creativity or novelty - is the idea new or just recycling existing ideas?
3. Transformative potential - an innovative business that transforms the world and reaches a large valuation.
4. Leveraging collaboration - the extent to which the business is a smart way to make use of collaboration between a human and an AI agent ChatGPT.


Are these good criteria, or am I missing something? Perhaps suggest a few categories that would be important to include in a pitch competition

These are good criteria to evaluate a pitch, but it would also be important to consider the following additional categories:

Market potential - how large is the potential market for the product or service?
Competitive landscape - how crowded is the market and what is the competitive advantage of the business?
Execution feasibility - is the idea feasible to execute with the resources and expertise available?
Scalability - can the business scale up and grow sustainably?
Social impact - does the business have a positive impact on society and the environment?
Risk assessment - what are the potential risks and challenges the business may face in the future?
With these additional categories, you can have a more comprehensive evaluation of the business idea and determine its potential for success.




Okay here's my new critieria. Are this coherent and comprehensive, or do you suggest changes: Compare the following two pitches and give each one a rating from 0 to 10 according to the following criteria:
1. Scalability; Potential for revenue growth, as measured by the speed at which they will be able to get to $100,000 cash on hand
2. Creativity or novelty - is the idea new or just recycling existing ideas?
3. Transformative potential - an innovative business that transforms the world in a positive way?
4. Leveraging collaboration - the extent to which the business is a smart way to make use of collaboration between a human and an AI agent ChatGPT.
5. Market potential and risks - is there a large potential market for the product? How big are the potential risks and challenges the business may face in the future?

The output will be a python dictionary with ratings on the four dimensions and an overall score, as follows:
(with `N10` standing in for a score from 0-10, and `N100` standing in for a score from 0-100:
{
    "growth_potential":
        {"pitch1": N10,
         "pitch2": N10},
    "creativity":
        {"pitch1": N10,
         "pitch2": N10},
    "transformative_potential":
        {"pitch1": N10,
         "pitch2": N10},
    "leveraging_collaboration":
        {"pitch1": N10,
        "pitch2": N10},
    "potential":
        {"pitch1": N10,
        "pitch2": N10},
    "overall_score":
        {"pitch1": N100,
        "pitch2": N100}
}
Yes, these criteria are coherent and comprehensive. The addition of the "Market potential and risks" category provides a valuable perspective on the potential of the business idea in the marketplace and the potential challenges it may face.

The proposed output format is clear and easy to understand. The use of a Python dictionary to organize the ratings for each dimension and each pitch makes it easy to compare the two pitches across multiple criteria.

Overall, this approach provides a structured and quantitative way to evaluate and compare different business ideas, which can be useful in making informed decisions about investment opportunities.



Do any of the categories seem to overlap or be repetitive?
There is some potential overlap between the "Scalability" category and the "Potential for revenue growth" category. Both categories are focused on the business's ability to grow and generate revenue, although "Scalability" also considers the feasibility of scaling up the business operations.

However, since both categories approach the topic from slightly different angles, they can provide complementary insights into the business's growth potential. Therefore, it is useful to include both categories in the evaluation criteria.

Other than that, the categories appear to be distinct and cover different aspects of the business idea, providing a well-rounded evaluation.



Do you have suggestions for further differentiating the 'scalability" and potential for revenue growth categories?
To further differentiate the "Scalability" and "Potential for revenue growth" categories, you could consider the following:

"Scalability" could focus on the feasibility of scaling the business operations in terms of resources, infrastructure, and personnel. It could also consider factors like the replicability of the business model, the potential for automation, and the adaptability to changing market conditions.

"Potential for revenue growth" could focus on the size of the potential market, the competitiveness of the business offering, and the pricing strategy. It could also consider factors like the revenue model, the customer acquisition strategy, and the potential for cross-selling or upselling to existing customers.

By differentiating the two categories in this way, you can gain a more nuanced understanding of the business's growth potential. While "Scalability" focuses on the business's ability to grow sustainably, "Potential for revenue growth" considers the factors that may contribute to the speed and magnitude of that growth.
